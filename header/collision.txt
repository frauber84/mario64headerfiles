0005: Mario can hang from the ceiling
000A: Bottom of level (death)

[ 000D = ???? ]

000E: Water currents (8 bytes per tri) the two last bytes of each triangle defines direction and force of current
0012: Falling in void (Haunted House)
0013: Very slippery hill
0014: Slippery hill
0015: Climbable hills
001B: Switches to area 1 (Used in Wet/Dry World)
001C: Switches to area 2 (Used in Wet/Dry World and Tall Tall slide to seemingly switch between areas)
001D: Switches to area 3 (Used in Tall Tall slide to seemingly switch between areas)
001E: Switches to area 4 (Used in Tall Tall slide to seemingly switch between areas)
0023: Quicksand
0024: Moving sand 1
0025: Moving sand 2
0026: Moving sand 3
[ 0027 = Another moving sand + quicksand ]
0028: Wall/fence
0029: Grass/flat
002A: Un-climbable hill
002C: Wind
[ 002D = moving sand (death) ]
0030: Flat

[ 0032 = Same as death in bottom?? ]

0033: Starting line in Princess Secret Slide
0034: Finish line in Princess Secret Slide
0036: snowy ice stuff
0037: snowy ice stuff

[ 0038 = Death at bottom with wind ]

002E: Icy
0041: NOP
0042: End Collision Data
0043: Special objects
0065: Top of Bob Omb Battlefield mountain wide angle camera ]only works in Bob-omb Battlefield?]
0066: Walls Tiny Huge Island area 3
006F: Camera turn in Bowser Course 1
0070: Camera turns in BoB
[ 0072 = Inacessible area (bounds?) ]
0075: Camera stuff Cool Cool Mountain
0079: Flat non-slippery floor in Princess Secret Slide
007B: Vanishing walls. (non-solid when Mario wears the Vanish cap)
00FD: Pool Warp in Hazy Maze Cave
00A6-00Cx: Painting warps areas (in front)
00D0: Limited camera movements in narrow hallways (part of Hazy Maze Cave)
00D3-00F8: Painting warps areas (behind)

from rstewart215804:

Some collision data has 8 bytes per triangle instead of 6. The extra 2 bytes supply more per face settings. Terrain types 0x0024, 0x000E, and
0x002C are the most common ones that have extra 2 bytes


Terrain type 0x0024 is one of the moving sands. The extra 2 bytes tell which direction to push Mario in.
Terrain type 0x000E only works in water. It creates water currents that push Mario while swimming.
Terrain type 0x002C causes horizontal wind and its direction is controlled by the last two bytes.
